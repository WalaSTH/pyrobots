## Instalation and usage
This project is yet to be deployed so in order to run it you have to run the backend and frontend processes locally.

For the backend you will need Python 3.10.12 and pip to install all the requirements.

For the frontend, you will need Node.js v19.8.1 or higher

### Backend
First, move to the _backend_ directory:

```cd backend```

Install requirements:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

And then run:

```uvicorn app:app```

### Frontend
Move to _frontend_ directory:

```cd frontend```

Install node modules:

```npm install```

And finally run:

```npm start```


Users can create an account, and after validateing their email, they can fully start using the app.
